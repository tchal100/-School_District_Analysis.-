Overview of the school district analysis:

After an analysis of grade results within the school, Thomas High School board has realized that there was dishonesty within the last analysis. The grades of reading and math appeared to have been changed. Thomas High School wants to uphold the testing standards of the state and decided that a thorough analyst should be done.  
We have been tasked to complete a thorough analysis on Thomas High School math and reading grades.
Here are a few of the questions we have answered.
1.	How was the district affected?

Prior to our audit the initial district results showed that the Passing Math results were at 74% while the Passing reading was at 85%. One can see that the Math results were much lower after the Analysis at 67% and the reading at 81%

Before Analysis

	Total Schools	Total Students	Total Budget	Average Math Score	Average Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing
0	15	39170	24649428	78.985371	81.87784	74.980853	85.805463	65.172326
								

After Analysis

Average Math Score	Average Reading Score	% Passing Math	% Passing Reading	% Overall Passing School Type
Charter	83.5	83.9	90	93	87
District	77.0	81.0	67	81	54

The overall district percentage was raised by 10% by the dishonest incident.



2.	How is the school summary affected?
The overall school summary remained quite the same except for the math and reading. Although the budget did not show any changes one could argue the potential impact to future budgets if the dishonesty lasted for several years. 

3.	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s
Performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School scores were unfortunately much lower after the analysis, which showed that replacing the students grades with accurate ones affected the standing of the school within the district.

4.	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
1.	Math and reading scores by grade
The overall grades were lowered when the accurate data was taken into consideration. 
2.	Scores by school spending.
Because of the range of budget per the grade and school sizes the spending budget was not affected by the misinformation. 
3.	Scores by school size
The school size scores had no visible change: however, some of the coding were coming up with errors.
Based on the analysis of Thomas High School the new data would not have affected the overall score size.
4.	Scores by school type
Thomas High School is a Charter school. There was no major effect on the Scores by school type because of the range. 
Summary: 
There were several changes in the updated school Analysis. The first affect was the difference in Math and Reading grades which caused a decline in the school and district grade scores. However, the percentage mainly affected Thomas High School overall standings in the state. Fortunately, the incident did not cause any other major change that could have affected Thomas High School negatively.
